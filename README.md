# Cara's Bootstrap Portoflio

## Description
The project at hand is to build a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.
This project flowed smoothly in terms of formatting the styling of the page. It was a lot easier to create the aesthetic that I was looking for in comparison to the previous portfolio project. In hindsight of the previous project, it made sense to first learn the fundamentals of CSS styling without bootstrap, because the knowledge gained from this helped me to learn where to input the Bootstrap codes.

## Successes and Improvements to be made
Successes:
Based on the visuals above, I was able to succesfully build a webpage that is relatively responsive across screen sizes.

- Links that navigate to the appropriate sections, A hero section, A jumbotron featuring my picture, my name, and description.

    - My work section displaying my work in grid form, Along with placeholders that represent my future projects using bootsrap cards.
    
    - A skills section listing the skills I expect to learn from the bootcamp.

    - An about / contact section, linking to all the correct places.

      - An "About Me" section with a description. 
      - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect, and buttons display a box shadow upon hover.
      
Improvements to be made:
Although responsive, I do believe that the UX could be better, but as each project progresses, I'll educate myself further on UX/UI fundamentals in order to try and improve the look of webpages I build moving forward.
